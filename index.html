				<h1>This is a test page</h1>
				<p>Nine hundred years of time and space, and I've never been slapped by someone's mother. I am not a student of human nature. I am a professor of a far wider academy of which human nature is merely a part. If you could touch the alien sand and hear the cries of strange birds, and watch them wheel in another sky, would that satisfy you? The trouble with computers, of course, is that they're very sophisticated idiots. They do exactly what you tell them at amazing speed. Even if you order them to kill you. So if you do happen to change your mind, it's very difficult to stop them from obeying the original order. But not impossible.</p>

				<p>I had to face my fear...that was more important than just going on living.... You were expecting someone else? Our lives are different from anybody else’s. That’s the exciting thing. Nobody in the universe can do what we’re doing. As we learn about each other, so we learn about ourselves. Yeah, I came first in jiggery pokery, what about you? It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York.</p>

				<p>And everybody lives, Rose! Everybody lives! I need more days like this! Go on, ask me anything; I'm on fire! Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about…? Oh I'm so sorry, Jamie. Planets come and go. Stars perish. Matter disperses, coalesces, forms into other patterns, other worlds. Nothing can be eternal. Well, there's a probability of anything. Statistically speaking, if you gave typewriters to a treeful of monkeys, they'd eventually produce the works of William Shakespeare. It's all right up to the eyebrows. Then it goes haywire.</p>

				<p>When this is all over, you can find a shoulder to cry on. But for now, you need me. My personal plan is that a thing will probably happen quite soon. Subject for catalogue: file under 'imagination, comma, lack of'. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. If you could touch the alien sand and hear the cries of strange birds, and watch them wheel in another sky, would that satisfy you? You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'.</p>

				<p>The Time Lords are an immensely civilised race. We can control our own environment - we can live forever, barring accidents, and we have the secret of space/time travel. No… No-no-no-no-wait-wait-wait-wait… I remember I'm-I-I… I'm with my father, we're lying back in the grass, it's a warm Gallifreyan night— We are always in trouble! Isn't it extraordinary—it follows us everywhere. Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! An unintelligent enemy is far less dangerous than an intelligent one….</p>

				<p>Can I talk about planets now? I don't want to go. Oh, my giddy aunt! I reversed the polarity of the neutron flow. Goodbye... Fancypants! Change, my dear. And it seems not a moment too soon. When this is all over, you can find a shoulder to cry on. But for now, you need me. People spend all their time making nice things and then other people come along and break them! Sorry, must dash! I think it's time to find your Achilles heel, or should I say - flipper. Do try and keep out of my way in future and in past, there's a good fellow. The time continuum should be big enough for the both of us.</p>

				<p>There's always something to look at if you open your eyes! So you've got a room for not being awake in. What's the point? You're just missing the room! Sorry, must dash! My carer. She cares so I don't have to. I need...I need...I need... fish fingers and custard! My ship…my TARDIS… Why can't you leave me alone?! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezzes are cool. Do you wanna come with me? 'Cause if you do, then I should warn you — you're gonna see all sorts of things. Ghosts from the past. Aliens from the future. The day the Earth died in a ball of flame. It won't be quiet, it won't be safe, and it won't be calm. But I'll tell you what it will be: The trip of a lifetime!</p>

				<p>Why can't you leave me alone?! Life depends on change and renewal. Oh, my giddy aunt! It all started out as a mild curiosity in the junkyard, and now it's turned out to be quite a great spirit of adventure. Am I having a midlife crisis? Why are you pointing your screwdrivers like that? They're scientific instruments not water pistols! Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! Why do you have three mirrors? Why don't you just turn your head? Let's go in!</p>
